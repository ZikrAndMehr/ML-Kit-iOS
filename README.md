# Welcome to ML-Kit Integration!

This app showcases the seamless integration of various ML-Kit functionalities from Google for iOS devices.

## Introduction

This iOS app demonstrates the implementation of ML-Kit features for barcode scanning, text recognition, image labeling, language identification, translation, and handwritten text recognition services.

## Getting Started

To get started with the  ML-Kit app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Open the project in Xcode.

3. Install the necessary dependencies using CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager.
4. Build and run the app on a simulator or device.

## App Details

To utilize the ML-Kit functionalities integrated into this app, refer to the following sections:

- **Barcode Scanning**: This feature allows you to scan various types of barcodes using the device's camera. Simply navigate to the Barcode Scanning page and position the barcode within the camera frame. The app will automatically identify and process the barcode information.

- **Text Recognition**: When you go to the Text Recognition page, you can capture an image containing text. The app will process the image and extract the text content, making it accessible for further actions or processing.

- **Image Labeling**: In the Image Labeling section, you can choose or capture an image. The ML-Kit will analyze the image and provide a list of labels or tags associated with objects present in the image.

- **Language Identification**: This functionality helps identify the language used in a given text. Navigate to the Language Identification page, enter or paste the text, and the app will identify the language.

- **Translation**: On the Translation page, you can input text in one language and specify the target language. The app will utilize ML-Kit to provide a translation of the text into the desired language.

- **Handwritten Text Recognition**: This feature allows you to capture an image containing handwritten text. The ML-Kit will process the image and transcribe the handwritten content into digital text.

## Important

Please note that some features may require an internet connection for optimal performance, as certain ML-Kit functionalities may utilize cloud-based models.
